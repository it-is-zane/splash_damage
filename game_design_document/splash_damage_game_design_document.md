Concept
- Gameplay Overview
The players loop between two minigames, a crafting minigame, where you use Alchemical Materials you've collected to design splash potions, and a battle minigame, where you chuck the potions you've designed to destroy an enemies base angry birds style, in order to collect more materials for potions.
- Theme Interpretation (Shadows and Alchemy)
We got Alchemy with the potion crafting. For shadows, we could have the enemies be flavored in a shadow way. (If we wanted to do vampires again, the angry birds section could be about knocking down the roofs and exposing enemy undead to the sun (also holy water)).
- Primary Mechanics
Crafting - (creatively combining materials into differently powered potions)
